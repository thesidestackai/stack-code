Claw Code is the public Rust implementation of the `claw` CLI agent harness.
The canonical implementation lives in [`rust/`](./rust), and the current source of truth for this repository is **ultraworkers/claw-code**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Start with [`USAGE.md`](./USAGE.md) for build, auth, CLI, session, and parity-harness workflows. Make `claw doctor` your first health check after building, use [`rust/README.md`](./rust/README.md) for crate-level details, read [`PARITY.md`](./PARITY.md) for the current Rust-port checkpoint, and see [`docs/container.md`](./docs/container.md) for the container-first workflow.
>
> **ACP / Zed status:** `claw-code` does not ship an ACP/Zed daemon entrypoint yet. Run `claw acp` (or `claw --acp`) for the current status instead of guessing from source layout; `claw acp serve` is currently a discoverability alias only, and real ACP support remains tracked separately in `ROADMAP.md`.

## Current repository shape

- **`rust/`** — canonical Rust workspace and the `claw` CLI binary
- **`USAGE.md`** — task-oriented usage guide for the current product surface
- **`PARITY.md`** — Rust-port parity status and migration notes
- **`ROADMAP.md`** — active roadmap and cleanup backlog
- **`PHILOSOPHY.md`** — project intent and system-design framing
- **`src/` + `tests/`** — companion Python/reference workspace and audit helpers; not the primary runtime surface

## Quick start

> [!NOTE]
> [!WARNING]
> **`cargo install claw-code` installs the wrong thing.** The `claw-code` crate on crates.io is a deprecated stub that places `claw-code-deprecated.exe` — not `claw`. Running it only prints `"claw-code has been renamed to agent-code"`. **Do not use `cargo install claw-code`.** Either build from source (this repo) or install the upstream binary:
> ```bash
> cargo install agent-code   # upstream binary — installs 'agent.exe' (Windows) / 'agent' (Unix), NOT 'agent-code'
> ```
> This repo (`ultraworkers/claw-code`) is **build-from-source only** — follow the steps below.

```bash
# 1. Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/ultraworkers/claw-code
cd claw-code/rust
cargo build --workspace

# 2. Set your API key (Anthropic API key — not a Claude subscription)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# 3. Verify everything is wired correctly
cargo run -p rusty-claude-cli -- doctor

# 4. Run a prompt
cargo run -p rusty-claude-cli -- prompt "say hello"
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Windows (PowerShell):** the binary is `claw.exe`, not `claw`. Run `cargo run -- prompt "say hello"` to skip direct binary path lookup.

### Windows setup

**PowerShell is a supported Windows path.** Use whichever shell works for you. The common onboarding issues on Windows are:

1. **Install Rust first** — download from <https://rustup.rs/> and run the installer. Close and reopen your terminal when it finishes.
2. **Verify Rust is on PATH:**
   ```powershell
   cargo --version
   ```
   If this fails, reopen your terminal or run the PATH setup from the Rust installer output, then retry.
3. **Clone and build** (works in PowerShell, Git Bash, or WSL):
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/ultraworkers/claw-code
   cd claw-code/rust
   cargo build --workspace
   ```
4. **Run** (PowerShell — note `.exe` and backslash):
   ```powershell
   $env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-..."
   cargo run -p rusty-claude-cli -- prompt "say hello"
   ```

**Git Bash / WSL** are optional alternatives, not requirements. If you prefer bash-style paths (`/c/Users/you/...` instead of `C:\Users\you\...`), Git Bash (ships with Git for Windows) works well. In Git Bash, the `MINGW64` prompt is expected and normal — not a broken install.

## Post-build: locate the binary and verify

After running `cargo build --workspace`, the `claw` binary is built but **not** automatically installed to your system. Do not assume Cargo wrote it under `rust/target`; local config, `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, or `--target-dir` may redirect build artifacts.

### Binary location

After `cargo build --workspace` in `claw-code/rust/`, ask Cargo for the active target directory:

```bash
TARGET_DIR="$(
  cargo metadata --format-version 1 --no-deps |
  python3 -c 'import json, sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["target_directory"])'
)"
```

**Debug build (default, faster compile):**
- **macOS/Linux:** `$TARGET_DIR/debug/claw`
- **Windows:** `$TARGET_DIR/debug/claw.exe`

**Release build (optimized, slower compile):**
- **macOS/Linux:** `$TARGET_DIR/release/claw`
- **Windows:** `$TARGET_DIR/release/claw.exe`

If you ran `cargo build` without `--release`, the binary is in the `debug/` folder.

On Suki's workstation, `rust/.cargo/config.toml` redirects Cargo build artifacts to the 18TB build-artifacts drive. Use `cargo metadata --format-version 1 --no-deps` to confirm `target_directory` instead of assuming a workspace-local target directory.

### Verify the build succeeded

Test the binary directly using its path:

```bash
# macOS/Linux (debug build)
"$TARGET_DIR/debug/claw" --help
"$TARGET_DIR/debug/claw" doctor

# Windows PowerShell (debug build)
cargo run -p rusty-claude-cli -- --help
cargo run -p rusty-claude-cli -- doctor
```

If these commands succeed, the build is working. `claw doctor` is your first health check — it validates your API key, model access, and tool configuration.

### Optional: Add to PATH

If you want to run `claw` from any directory without the full path, choose one of these approaches:

**Option 1: Link the active Cargo-built binary (macOS/Linux)**
```bash
TARGET_DIR="$(
  cd rust &&
  cargo metadata --format-version 1 --no-deps |
  python3 -c 'import json, sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["target_directory"])'
)"
ln -s "$TARGET_DIR/debug/claw" /usr/local/bin/claw
```
Then reload your shell and test:
```bash
claw --help
```

**Option 2: Use `cargo install` (all platforms)**

Build and install to Cargo's default location (`~/.cargo/bin/`, which is usually on PATH):
```bash
# From the claw-code/rust/ directory
cargo install --path . --force

# Then from anywhere
claw --help
```

**Option 3: Update shell profile (bash/zsh)**

Add this line to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
TARGET_DIR="$(
  cd /path/to/claw-code/rust &&
  cargo metadata --format-version 1 --no-deps |
  python3 -c 'import json, sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["target_directory"])'
)"
export PATH="$TARGET_DIR/debug:$PATH"
```

Reload your shell:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
claw --help
```

### Troubleshooting

- **"command not found: claw"** — Ask Cargo for `target_directory`, then use `$TARGET_DIR/debug/claw` or link/install as above.
- **"permission denied"** — On macOS/Linux, you may need `chmod +x "$TARGET_DIR/debug/claw"` if the executable bit isn't set (rare).
- **Debug vs. release** — If the build is slow, you're in debug mode (default). Add `--release` to `cargo build` for faster runtime, but the build itself will take 5–10 minutes.

> [!NOTE]
> **Auth:** claw requires an **API key** (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.) — Claude subscription login is not a supported auth path.

Run the workspace test suite after verifying the binary works:

```bash
cd rust
cargo test --workspace
```
